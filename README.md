This repo contains basic neural networks I used to learn how to implement forward and backward propagation. The two layer neural network is from a post by iamtrask (https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/). For the other two, I adapted this original network to include one or two hidden layers and back-propagation.

Everything can be run with Python3 and numpy.
